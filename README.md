## Eleições Municipais
This project was developed during a course of my master.
The main goal was to show the political scenario evolution along the last
five elections on all **brazilian cities**.

This current release only shows the Rio de Janeiro State on a map.
It is still in early development and in current moment, the district chamber chart(sankey chart), is fixed only on the capital.

Later, it will have all the state to be chosen, having the possibility to looking at any city in the last five city elections.

The main data source is TSE [Tribunal Superior Eleitoral](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais), the major authority in brazilian electoral system.

The other data were gathered on:
[Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_partidos_pol%C3%ADticos_no_Brasil)
[IBGE](http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/)
