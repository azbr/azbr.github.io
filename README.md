# Eleições Municipais

## Description

This project was started during a visualization course on my master.
The main goal was to show the evolution in the political scenario along the past
five elections on all **brazilian cities** with the help of the nice javascript library [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and jQuery.

This current release only shows the State of Rio de Janeiro on a choropleth chart.
It still is in early development, with the district chamber chart(sankey chart) fixed only at the capital of state.

The main data source is the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral [TSE](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/estatisticas/repositorio-de-dados-eleitorais), the major authority in brazilian electoral system.

The other data were gathered on:<br />
[Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_partidos_pol%C3%ADticos_no_Brasil)<br />
[IBGE](http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/)
